Curated list of resources for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Language Models.

# Language models

The paper [Transformer models: an introduction and catalog](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07730.pdf) contains a very comprenshive of the existing language models.


# Open source projects which can produce models

* https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant
* [EluetherAI](http://www.eleuther.ai/)
* [Carper.ai](https://carper.ai/)

# RLFH open source libraries

* https://github.com/allenai/RL4LMs - provide easily customizable building blocks for training language models including implementations of on-policy algorithms, reward functions, metrics, datasets and LM based actor-critic policies
* https://github.com/lvwerra/trl -  train transformer language models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The library is built on top of the transformers library by hugs Hugging Face.
